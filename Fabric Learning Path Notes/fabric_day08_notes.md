# ðŸ“˜ Microsoft Fabric â€“ Study Notes (Day 8)

## ðŸ”· Module 1: Introduction to End-to-End Analytics using Microsoft Fabric

**Microsoft Fabric** is an all-in-one Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform for modern analytics that unifies data engineering, data science, and business intelligence in a single environment.  
It enables **end-to-end data workflows** â€“ from ingestion and transformation to visualization â€“ all in one integrated stack.

Key components of Microsoft Fabric include:  
ðŸ”¹ **OneLake** â€“ a unified data lake storage layer for the entire platform  
ðŸ”¹ **Lakehouse** â€“ combines the scalability of Data Lakes with the structure of Data Warehouses  
ðŸ”¹ **Data Engineering**, **Data Science**, **Data Factory**, and **Power BI** â€“ working seamlessly together  

Fabric promotes collaboration across data teams by centralizing architecture and access to a single source of truth.

## ðŸ”· Module 2: Get Started with Lakehouses in Microsoft Fabric

**Lakehouse** is a central data layer in Fabric built on OneLake, allowing structured and unstructured data storage using open formats like Delta/Parquet.  

Key concepts and hands-on exercises covered:  
ðŸ”¹ Created a **Lakehouse** and uploaded datasets into the `Tables` and `Files` folders  
ðŸ”¹ Used **SQL endpoint** to explore structured tables  
ðŸ”¹ Created a basic **Spark notebook** using PySpark to query and analyze the data  
ðŸ”¹ Lakehouses are ideal for scalable, collaborative analytics and integrate smoothly with BI and machine learning tools

## âœ… Summary Takeaways

ðŸ”¹ Fabric unifies multiple data disciplines and tools into a single analytics ecosystem  
ðŸ”¹ Lakehouses provide flexibility and power for both engineering and analytical workloads  
ðŸ”¹ SQL and Spark endpoints allow fast, familiar access to raw and transformed data  
ðŸ”¹ The user experience is smooth and intuitive, even in early exploration
